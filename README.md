# Player Checkpoint (PoC)

This project is a proof of concept! (PoC)

I am a big immersive open-world action rpg and a big minecraft fan.
I'm planning on making a game that is inspired by the story and structure of
[Hogwarts Legacy (Don't Support J. K. Rowling)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/xm0tm1/hogwarts_legacy_dont_buy_it/)
or Star Wars Battlefront story mode. Other examples would be Cyberpunk 2077 or Red Dead Redemption.
In these games it is almost always possible to set a save point at any point. In my opinion,
it is unwise to save the world in a minecraft rpg. Since there are always different locations
and scenarios in which such games are played, these different locations are always made available
as world templates and only the player data is saved.
The aim of this project is to develop an example of this mechanism.
